===================
 Website Demo Data
===================

If you are looking for *Mult Website* feature use module `Real Multi Website <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/10.0/website_multi_company>`_ instead.

Demo-specific updates
=====================
Following features are not recommended to be added to non-demo installation (this is why we don't put demo data directly to website_multi_company module)

* After first login website domains are updated. See `<models/res_users.py>`_
* Once after installation: Set default website for all categories without website value
